These services often include automated integration with cloud service infrastructure to remove manual burden and ensure information is accurate and up to date.\n\nThis security and compliance information (including FedRAMP authorization data) is the intellectual property of the cloud service provider and is not federal information in most cases.* The federal government benefits when the same security information is shared among all customers and even the public to ensure maximum transparency and accountability of cloud service providers.\n\nThe FedRAMP Authorization Data Sharing Standard provides a process or mechanism for cloud service providers to store and share authorization data on their preferred platform of choice if it meets certain FedRAMP requirements.\n\nAt the initial release of this standard there will not be many platforms that directly support the requirements in this standard. FedRAMP anticipates this will change rapidly in response to market demand as platforms work to provide innovative solutions to these requirements.\n\n_* Providers with questions about this should consult with a lawyer who specializes in procurement law. Typically a contract with the government granting ownership of information is required to transfer ownership to the government._",

        "Trust center providers and GRC automation tool providers will develop innovative solutions and improvements to ensure standardized automated data sharing and validation within the FedRAMP ecosystem"
