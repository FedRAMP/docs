# pete's quick and dirty changelog

FRR = FedRAMP Requirements & Recommendations

## authorization data sharing

- the technical assistance was rolled into the appropriate FRR as an "examples" array

## minimum assessment scope

- All previous "MAS-AY" (application guidance) statements were moved to notes on the appropriate FRR

## significant change notifications

- technical assistance rolled into the appropriate FRR

## vulnerability detection and response

- technical assistance rolled up into the appropriate FRR
- restructured a bunch of stuff in the TFR section to vary by level instead of having separate requirements

# NOTES TO SELF

- gotta change all the references to old FRR-##'s 
- port the "example" functionality from FRA
- consider a different approach to explicit ordering, right now things are ordered by hand in the JSON data but it might seem haphazard
