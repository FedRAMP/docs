This creates a marketplace where cloud service providers can compete based on their individual approach and prioritization of security and agencies can choose to adopt cloud services with less effective security programs for less sensitive use cases while prioritizing cloud services with high performing security programs when needed.\n\nOver time, FedRAMP will automatically review the machine-readable authorization data shared by participating cloud service providers to begin scoring cloud service offerings based on how effectively they meet or exceed the requirements and recommendations in this and other FedRAMP 20x standards.\n\nAll existing FedRAMP requirements, including control statements, standards, and other guidelines that reference vulnerability scanning or formal Plans of Action and Milestones (POA&Ms) are superseded by this standard and MAY be ignored by providers of cloud service offerings that have met the requirements to adopt this standard with approval by FedRAMP.",

The simplest way to prevent exploitation of internet-reachable vulnerabilities is to intercept, inspect, filter, sanitize, reject, or otherwise deflect triggering payloads before they are processed by the vulnerable resource; once this prevention is in place the vulnerability should no longer be considered an internet-reachable vulnerability.\n\nA classic example of an internet-reachable vulnerability on systems that are not typically internet-accessible is SQL injection (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection), where an application stack behind a load balancer and firewall with no ability to route traffic to or from the internet can receive a payload indirectly from the internet that triggers the manipulation or compromise of data in a database that can only be accessed by an authorized connection from the application server on a private network.\n\nAnother simple example is the infamous Log4Shell (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log4Shell) vulnerability from 2021, where exploitation was possible via vulnerable internet-reachable resources deep in the application stack that were often not internet-accessible themselves."

          "statement": "The simple reality is that most traditional vulnerabilities discovered by scanners or during assessment are not likely to be exploitable; exploitation typically requires an unrealistic set of circumstances that will not occur during normal operation. The likelihood of exploitation will vary depending on so many factors that FedRAMP will not recommend a specific framework for approaching this beyond the recommendations and requirements in this document.\n\nThe proof, ultimately, is in the pudding - providers who regularly evaluate vulnerabilities as not likely exploitable without careful consideration are more likely to suffer from an adverse impact where the root cause was an exploited vulnerability that was improperly evaluated. If done recklessly or deliberately, such actions will have a potential adverse impact on a provider's FedRAMP authorization."
