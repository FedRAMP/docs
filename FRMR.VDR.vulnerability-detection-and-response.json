This creates a marketplace where cloud service providers can compete based on their individual approach and prioritization of security and agencies can choose to adopt cloud services with less effective security programs for less sensitive use cases while prioritizing cloud services with high performing security programs when needed.\n\nOver time, FedRAMP will automatically review the machine-readable authorization data shared by participating cloud service providers to begin scoring cloud service offerings based on how effectively they meet or exceed the requirements and recommendations in this and other FedRAMP 20x processes.\n\nAll existing FedRAMP requirements, including control statements, standards, and other guidelines that reference vulnerability scanning or formal Plans of Action and Milestones (POA&Ms) are superseded by this process and MAY be ignored by providers of cloud service offerings that have met the requirements to adopt this process with approval by FedRAMP.",

The likelihood of exploitation will vary depending on so many factors that FedRAMP will not recommend a specific framework for approaching this beyond the recommendations and requirements in this document.\n\nThe proof, ultimately, is in the pudding - providers who regularly evaluate vulnerabilities as not likely exploitable without careful consideration are more likely to suffer from an adverse impact where the root cause was an exploited vulnerability that was improperly evaluated. If done recklessly or deliberately, such actions will have a potential adverse impact on a provider's FedRAMP authorization."
