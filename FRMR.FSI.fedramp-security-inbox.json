These requirements for a FedRAMP Security Inbox apply to all cloud service providers to ensure this direct reliable path remains open, especially in the event of critical security issues.\n\nThis set of requirements focus specifically on communication that comes from FedRAMP and includes three categories of communication:\n\n1. Emergency communications that will only be used during an emergency where response times are critical to protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of federal customer data; this communication path will occasionally be tested by FedRAMP.\n\n2. Important communications that may require an elevated response due to a sensitive or potentially disruptive situation, typically related to ongoing authorization or other concerns.\n\n3. General communications that include all other messages from FedRAMP that may be managed by a cloud service provider following their standard operational process.\n\nAll Emergency and Important messages sent by FedRAMP will include specific actions, timeframes expected for action, and an explanation of the corrective actions that FedRAMP will take if the timeframes are not met. Failure to take timely action as required by Emergency communications will result in corrective action from FedRAMP.\n\nFedRAMP will conduct strictly controlled tests of response to emergency communications regularly and provide public notice of these tests in advance. The response times for these tests will be tracked by FedRAMP and made publicly available.\n\nThis set of requirements and recommendations include explicit requirements that FedRAMP will follow to ensure important communications or those sent during emergencies can be routed by cloud service providers separately from general communications.",
