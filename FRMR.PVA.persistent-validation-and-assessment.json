The activities of a secure service should be intentional, documented, and in a state that is always known and understood by the provider.\n\nSecure providers will design their business processes and technical procedures to maximize the use of automation, persistent validation, and reporting across the entirety of their cloud service offering. This reduces cost by increasing efficiency, enables fast agile delivery of new capabilities and prevents unintended drift between the deployed cloud service offering and the business goals for the offering. Secure providers leverage automated and independent audits to evaluate the validity and effectiveness of their secure practices.\n\nAll FedRAMP 20x Authorized providers are expected to implement persistent validation programs as part of their core engineering workflow. These programs should be optimized to deliver value to the provider and their engineering teams first and foremost, though agencies and other customers will benefit from the improved security and insight resulting from high quality persistent validation programs.\n\nTo obtain and maintain a FedRAMP 20x authorization, providers will be required to have their persistent validation programs assessed regularly for effectiveness and completeness.",
