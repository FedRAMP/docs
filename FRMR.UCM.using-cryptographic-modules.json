This acknowledges that not all Moderate impact federal customer data is considered “sensitive” and allows both cloud service providers and agency customers to make risk-based decisions about their use of Moderate impact services for agency use cases that do not include sensitive data.\n\nFedRAMP recommends that cloud service providers seeking FedRAMP authorization at the Moderate impact level use such cryptographic modules whenever technically feasible and reasonable but acknowledges there may be sound reasons not to do so across the board at the Moderate impact level. As always, the reasoning and justification for such decisions must be documented by the cloud service provider."
