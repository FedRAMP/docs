# Overview

FedRAMP is transitioning to a modern digital-first public experience for delivering documentation!

!!! info ""

    This project began with [FedRAMP 20x Machine Readable Documentation](https://github.com/FedRAMP/docs) and is under very active development. We are publishing all 20x requirements and recommendations in a machine-readable format with supporting automation to build web content from the latest JSON files. Additionally, a limited subset of Rev5 materials will be published over time as they are modernized.

## Documentation

The following documentation is available on this site:

| Area | Description |
| -- | -- |
| [20x Phase One](20xP1/intro) | Archived requirements from the 20x Phase One pilot for reference. **This content is no longer maintained and should only be used for reference.** |
| [20x Phase Two](20xP2/intro) | All requirements and recommendations for the 20x Phase Two pilot - this site is the authoritative source for the current version of documentation materials that cloud service providers will be held to during the 20x Phase Two pilot. |
