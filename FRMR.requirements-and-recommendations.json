Emergency communications that will only be used during an emergency where response times are critical to protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of federal customer data; this communication path will occasionally be tested by FedRAMP.\n\n2. Important communications that may require an elevated response due to a sensitive or potentially disruptive situation, typically related to ongoing authorization or other concerns.\n\n3. General communications that include all other messages from FedRAMP that may be managed by a cloud service provider following their standard operational process.\n\nAll Emergency and Important messages sent by FedRAMP will include specific actions, timeframes expected for action, and an explanation of the corrective actions that FedRAMP will take if the timeframes are not met. Failure to take timely action as required by Emergency communications will result in corrective action from FedRAMP.\n\nFedRAMP will conduct strictly controlled tests of response to emergency communications regularly and provide public notice of these tests in advance. The response times for these tests will be tracked by FedRAMP and made publicly available.\n\nThis set of requirements and recommendations include explicit requirements that FedRAMP will follow to ensure important communications or those sent during emergencies can be routed by cloud service providers separately from general communications.",

This reduces cost by increasing efficiency, enables fast agile delivery of new capabilities and prevents unintended drift between the deployed cloud service offering and the business goals for the offering. Secure providers leverage automated and independent audits to evaluate the validity and effectiveness of their secure practices.\n\nAll FedRAMP 20x Authorized providers are expected to implement persistent validation programs as part of their core engineering workflow. These programs should be optimized to deliver value to the provider and their engineering teams first and foremost, though agencies and other customers will benefit from the improved security and insight resulting from high quality persistent validation programs.\n\nTo obtain and maintain a FedRAMP 20x authorization, providers will be required to have their persistent validation programs assessed regularly for effectiveness and completeness.",
