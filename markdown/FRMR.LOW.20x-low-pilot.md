## Definitions

#### FRD-SCN-01

> **Significant change**: Has the meaning given in NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 2 which is &quot;a change that is _likely_ to substantively affect the security or privacy posture of a system.&quot;
>
>  _[Reference: NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 2](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/37/r2/final)_
#### FRD-SCN-02

> **Routine Recurring**: The type of _significant change_ that _regularly_ and routinely recurs as part of ongoing operations, vulnerability mitigation, or vulnerability remediation.
#### FRD-SCN-03

> **Adaptive**: The type of _significant change_ that does not routinely recur but does not introduce substantive potential security risks that need to be assessed in depth.
>
>  _Note: Adaptive changes typically require careful planning that focuses on engineering execution instead of customer adoption, can be verified with minor changes to existing automated validation procedures, and do not require large changes to operational procedures, deployment plans, or documentation._
#### FRD-SCN-04

> **Transformative**: The type of _significant change_ that introduces substantive potential security risks that are _likely_ to affect existing risk determinations and must be assessed in depth.
>
>  _Note: Transformative changes typically introduce major features or capabilities that may change how a customer uses the service (in whole or in part) and require extensive updates to security assessments, operational procedures, deployment plans, and documentation._
#### FRD-SCN-05

> **Impact Categorization**: The type of _significant change_ that is _likely_ to increase or decrease the impact level categorization for the entire cloud service offering (e.g. from low to moderate or from high to moderate).
#### FRD-SCN-06

> **Interim Requirement**: A temporary requirement included as part of a FedRAMP Pilot or Beta Test that will _likely_ be replaced, updated, or removed prior to the formal wide release of the requirement.
#### FRD-MAS-01

> **Federal Information**: Has the meaning from OMB Circular A-130 and any successor documents. As of Apr 2025, this means &quot;information created, collected, processed, maintained, disseminated, disclosed, or disposed of by or for the federal government, in any medium or form.&quot;
>
>  _Note: This typically does not include information that a cloud service provider produces outside of a government contract or agreement. Review FedRAMP&#x27;s Technical Assistance and consult qualified legal experts for additional assistance identifying federal information._
>
>  _[Reference: OMB Circular A-130](https://whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/legacy_drupal_files/omb/circulars/A130/a130revised.pdf)_
#### FRD-MAS-02

> **Information Resource**: Has the meaning from 44 USC ยง 3502 (6): &quot;information and related resources, such as personnel, equipment, funds, and information technology.&quot;
>
>  _Note: This applies to any aspect of the _cloud service offering_, both technical and managerial, including everything that makes up the business of the offering from organizational policies and procedures to hardware, software, and code._
>
>  _[Reference: 44 USC ยง 3502 (6)](https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/USCODE-2023-title44/USCODE-2023-title44-chap35-subchapI-sec3502)_
#### FRD-MAS-03

> **Handle**: Has the plain language meaning inclusive of any possible action taken with information, such as access, collect, control, create, display, disclose, disseminate, dispose, maintain, manipulate, process, receive, review, store, transmit, use... etc.
#### FRD-MAS-04

> **Likely**: A reasonable degree of probability based on context.
#### FRD-MAS-05

> **Third-party Information Resource**: Any _information resource_ that is not entirely included in the assessment for the _cloud service offering_ seeking authorization.
#### FRD-MAS-06

> **Cloud Service Offering**: A specific, packaged cloud computing product or service provided by a cloud service provider that can be used by a customer. FedRAMP assessment and authorization of the cloud computing product or service is based on the Minimum Assessment Standard.
#### FRD-KSI-01

> **Regularly**: Performing the activity on a consistent, predictable, and repeated basis, at set intervals, automatically if possible, following a documented plan. These intervals may vary as appropriate between different requirements.

# Technical assistance

### FRA-SCN

**Purpose:** This Technical Assistance helps stakeholders evaluate and label _significant changes_ by type as required by _FRR-SCN-03_. This assistance is designed for the 20x Phase One Pilot and Rev5 Closed Beta Balance Improvement Test. The Significant Change Notification Requirements will be tested, evaluated, and improved in partnership with stakeholders based on real-world experience.

**Disclaimer:** Every cloud service provider is different, every architecture is different, and every environment is different. Best practices and technical assistance MUST NOT be used as a checklist. All examples are for discussion purposes ONLY.

****

#### FRA-SCN-03

Once a change has been identified as a _significant change_ in general, FedRAMP recommends next determining if a change is of the type _routine recurring_. If it is not, work down from the highest impact to lowest to identify the type of change.

1. Is it a _significant change_?
2. If it is, is it a _routine recurring_ change?
3. If it is not, is it an _impact categorization_ change?
4. If it is not, is it a _transformative_ change?
5. If it is not, then it is an _adaptive_ change.

---   

#### FRA-SCN-RR

Activities that match the _routine recurring_ _significant change_ type are performed _regularly_ and routinely by cloud service providers to address flaws or vulnerabilities, address incidents, and generally perform the typical maintenance and service delivery changes expected during day-to-day operations.

These changes leverage mature processes and capabilities to identify, mitigate, and remediate risks as part of the change. They are often entirely automated and may occur without human intervention, even though they have an impact on security of the service.

If the activity does not occur _regularly_ and routinely then it cannot be a _significant change_ of this type (e.g., replacing all physical firewalls to remediate a vulnerability is obviously not regular or routine).

##### Ongoing operations

Key Tests:

- Routine care and feeding by staff during normal duties
- No major impact to service availability
- Does not require executive approval

Examples:

- Provisioning or deprovisioning capacity to support service elasticity
- Changing or tuning performance configurations for instances or services
- Updating and maintaining operational handling of information flows and protection across physical and logical networks (e.g., updating firewall rules)
- Generating or refreshing API or access tokens
##### Vulnerability Management

Key Tests:

- Minor, incremental patching or updates
- Significant refactoring or migration process NOT required
- No breaking changes

Examples:

- Updating security service or endpoint signatures
- Routine patching of devices, operating systems, software or libraries
- Updating and deploying code that applies normal fixes and improvements as part of a regular development cycle
- Vulnerability remediation activity that simply replaces a known-bad component(s) with a better version of the exact same thing, running in the exact same way with no changes to processes
---   

#### FRA-SCN-TF

Activities that match the _transformative_ _significant change_ type are rare for a cloud service offering, adjusted for the size, scale, and complexity of the service. Small cloud service offerings may go years without _transformative_ changes, while hyperscale providers may release multiple _transformative_ changes per year.

##### Transformative changes

Key Tests:

- Alters the service risk profile or require new or significantly different actions to address customer responsibilities
- Requires significant new design, development and testing with discrete associated project planning, budget, marketing, etc.
- Requires extensive updates to security assessments, documentation, and how a large number of security requirements are met and validated

Examples:

- The addition, removal, or replacement of a critical third party service that handles a significant portion of information (e.g., IaaS change)
- Increasing the security categorization of a service within the offering that actively handles federal information (does NOT include impact change of entire offering - see impact categorization change)
- Replacement of underlying management planes or paradigm shift in workload orchestration (e.g., bare-metal servers or virtual machines to containers, migration to kubernetes)
- Datacenter migration where large amounts of federal information is moved across boundaries different from normal day-to-day operations
- Adding a new AI-based capability that impacts federal information in a different way than existing services or capabilities (such as integrating a new third-party service or training on federal information)
---   

#### FRA-SCN-AD

Activities that match the _adaptive_ _significant change_ type are a frequent and normal part of iteratively improving a service by deploying new functionality or modifying existing functionality in a way that is typically transparent to customers and does not introduce significant new security risks.

In general, most changes that do not happen _regularly_ will be _adaptive_ changes. This change type deliberately covers a wide range of activities in a way that requires assessment and consideration.

##### Service adjustments

Key Tests:

- Requires minimal changes to security plans or procedures
- Requires some careful planning and project management to implement, but does not rise to the level of planning required for transformative changes
- Requires verification of existing functionality and secure configuration after implementation

Examples:

- Updates to operating systems, containers, virtual machines, software or libraries with known breaking changes, complex steps, or service disruption
- Deploying larger than normal incremental feature improvements in code or libraries that are the work of multiple weeks of development efforts but are not considered a major new service
- Changing cryptographic modules where the new module meets the same standards and characteristics of the former
- Replacing a like-for-like component where some security plan or procedure adjustments are required (e.g., scanning tool or managed database swap)
- Adding models to existing approved AI services without exposing federal information to new services
