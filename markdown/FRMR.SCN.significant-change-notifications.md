# FedRAMP Significant Change Notification Requirements

- **Release:** 25.06A
- **Published:** 2025-06-16  
- **Designator:** SCN
- **Description:** Initial release of Significant Change Notification Requirements

## Front Matter

### Effective Date(s) & Overall Applicability

- **FedRAMP 20x**:
  - This release is effective **2025-06-16** for **20xP1**. 
  - These requirements apply to all participants in the FedRAMP 20x Phase One pilot.
  - Key Security Indicators for Configuration Management (KSI-CMT) should be updated in alignment with the Significant Change Notification Standard.    

- **FedRAMP Rev5**:
  - This release is effective **2025-07-07** for **R5.SCN.B1** _(tentatively)_. 
  - These requirements will be initially tested and evaluated for Rev5 in the SCN Closed Beta (B1).
  - Providers MUST participate in a Balance Improvement Test to transition from the Significant Change Request process to the new Significant Change Notification process prior to wide release of this process for Rev5. Providers should participate in the FedRAMP Rev5 Community Working Group at https://www.fedramp.gov/community/ to follow this process.    



## Background & Authority
- [FedRAMP Authorization Act (44 USC ยง 3609 (a) (7))](https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/USCODE-2023-title44/USCODE-2023-title44-chap36-sec3609) directs the Administrator of the General Services Administration to &quot;coordinate with the FedRAMP Board, the Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and other entities identified by the Administrator, with the concurrence of the [OMB] Director and the [DHS] Secretary, to establish and regularly update a framework for continuous monitoring...&quot;  

  ([This responsibility is delegated to the FedRAMP Director](https://www.gsa.gov/directives-library/gsa-delegations-of-authority-fedramp).)
- [OMB Memorandum M-24-15 on Modernizing FedRAMP](https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/FedRAMP_Policy_Memo.pdf) section VI states &quot;FedRAMP should seek input from CSPs and develop processes that enable CSPs to maintain an agile deployment lifecycle that does not require advance Government approval, while giving the Government the visibility and information it needs to maintain ongoing confidence in the FedRAMP-authorized system and to respond timely and appropriately to incidents.&quot;  

  ([This responsibility is delegated to the FedRAMP PMO Director](https://www.gsa.gov/fedramp/about-federal-risk-and-authorizations-management-program-fedramp/fedramp-pmo-director).)

### Purpose

The Significant Change Notification (SCN) standard establishes conditions for FedRAMP authorized cloud service providers to make most significant changes without requiring advance government approval. Agency authorizing officials who authorize the use of FedRAMP authorized cloud services are expected to account for the risk of cloud service providers making changes to improve the service.

This standard broadly identifies four types of significant changes, from least impactful to most impactful:
1. Routine Recurring
2. Adaptive
3. Transformative
4. Impact Categorization

These categories, and the resulting requirements, apply only to significant changes.

### Expected Outcomes

- Cloud service providers will securely deliver new features and capabilities for government customers at the same speed and pace of delivery for commercial customers, without needing advance government approval
- Federal agencies will have equal access to features and capabilities as commercial customers without sacrificing the visibility and information they need to maintain ongoing confidence in the service

## Definitions

#### FRD-SCN-01

> **Significant Change**: Has the meaning given in NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 2 which is &quot;a change that is likely to SUBSTANTIVELY affect the security or privacy posture of a system.&quot;
>
>  _[Reference: NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 2](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/37/r2/final)_
#### FRD-SCN-02

> **Routine Recurring**: The type of significant change that routinely recurs as part of ongoing operations, vulnerability mitigation, or vulnerability remediation.
#### FRD-SCN-03

> **Adaptive**: The type of significant change that does not routinely recur but does not introduce substantive potential security risks that need to be assessed in depth.
>
>  _Note: Adaptive changes typically require careful planning that focuses on engineering execution instead of customer adoption, can be verified with minor changes to existing automated validation procedures, and do not require large changes to operational procedures, deployment plans, or documentation._
#### FRD-SCN-04

> **Transformative**: The type of significant change that introduces substantive potential security risks that are likely to affect existing risk determinations and must be assessed in depth.
>
>  _Note: Transformative changes typically introduce major features or capabilities that may change how a customer uses the service (in whole or in part) and require extensive updates to security assessments, operational procedures, deployment plans, and documentation._
#### FRD-SCN-05

> **Impact Categorization**: The type of significant change that is likely to increase or decrease the impact level categorization for the entire cloud service offering (e.g. from low to moderate or from high to moderate).
#### FRD-SCN-06

> **Interim Requirement**: A temporary requirement included as part of a FedRAMP Pilot or Beta Test that will likely be replaced, updated, or removed prior to the formal wide release of the requirement.
