# FedRAMP Key Security Indicators

- **Release:** 25.05D
- **Published:** 2025-08-24  
- **Designator:** KSI
- **Description:** Minor non-breaking updates to align term definitions and highlighted terms across updated materials (no changes to KSIs).

## Front Matter

### Effective Date(s) & Overall Applicability

- **FedRAMP 20x**:
  - This release is effective **2025-06-01** for **20xP1**. 
  - These requirements apply to all participants in the FedRAMP 20x Phase One pilot.
  - For FedRAMP 20x Low authorizations for cloud service offerings deployed on an existing FedRAMP authorized cloud service offering, using primarily cloud-native services, and only using FedRAMP authorized _third-party information resources_.  


### Documentation Guidelines

The following FedRAMP documentation guidelines apply to this document:

- The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [IETF RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119) when capitalized.
- _**ALL**_ FedRAMP-specific definitions in all FedRAMP standards apply to this document (not just the terms defined in this document).
- FedRAMP-specific terms with definitions are italicized throughout this document for reference.


## Background & Authority
- [OMB Circular A-130](https://whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/legacy_drupal_files/omb/circulars/A130/a130revised.pdf) Appendix I states &quot;Agencies may also develop overlays for specific types of information or communities of interest (e.g., all web-based applications, all health care-related systems) as part of the security control selection process. Overlays provide a specification of security or privacy controls, control enhancements, supplemental guidance, and other supporting information as part of the tailoring process, that is intended to complement (and further refine) security control baselines. The overlay may be more stringent or less stringent than the original security control baseline and can be applied to multiple information systems.&quot;
- [NIST SP 800-53B](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/b/upd1/final) Section 2.5 states &quot;As the number of controls in [SP 800-53] grows in response to an increasingly sophisticated threat space, it is important for organizations to have the ability to describe key capabilities needed to protect organizational missions and business functions, and to subsequently select controls that—if properly designed, developed, and implemented—produce such capabilities. The use of capabilities simplifies how the protection problem is viewed conceptually. Using the construct of a capability provides a method of grouping controls that are employed for a common purpose or to achieve a common objective.&quot; This section later states &quot;Ultimately, authorization decisions (i.e., risk acceptance decisions) are made based on the degree to which the desired capabilities have been effectively achieved.&quot;
- [NIST SP 800-53A](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/a/r5/final) Section 3.5 states &quot;When organizations employ the concept of capabilities, automated and manual assessments account for all security and privacy controls that comprise the security and privacy capabilities. Assessors are aware of how the controls work together to provide such capabilities.&quot;
- [FedRAMP Authorization Act (44 USC § 3609 (a) (1))](https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/USCODE-2023-title44/USCODE-2023-title44-chap36-sec3609) requires that the Administrator of the General Services Administration shall &quot;in consultation with the [DHS] Secretary, develop, coordinate, and implement a process to support agency review, reuse, and standardization, where appropriate, of security assessments of cloud computing products and services...&quot; 44 USC § 3609 (c) (2) further states that &quot;the [GSA] Administrator shall establish a means for the automation of security assessments and reviews.&quot;

### Purpose

Modern cloud services use automated or code-driven configuration management and control planes to ensure predictable, repeatable, reliable, and secure outcomes during deployment and operation. The majority of a service security assessment can take place continuously via automated validation for simple cloud-native services if the need for a traditional control-by-control narrative approach is removed.

### Expected Outcomes

- Cloud service providers following commercial security best practices will be able to meet and validate FedRAMP security requirements with the application of simple changes and automated capabilities
- Third-party independent assessors will have a simpler framework to assess security and implementation decisions based on engineering decisions in context
- Federal agencies will be able to easily, quickly, and effectively review and consume security information about the service to make informed risk-based authorization to operate decisions based on their planned use case
