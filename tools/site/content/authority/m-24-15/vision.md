# M-24-15 Section II. Vision

The purpose of the FedRAMP program is to increase Federal agencies' adoption and
secure use of the commercial cloud, by providing a standardized, reusable
approach to security assessments and authorizations for cloud computing products
and services. Through centralization, FedRAMP reduces duplicative authorization
activities, allowing CSPs to deliver and agencies to adopt secure cloud services
more efficiently. Focusing FedRAMP on the highest value work, as outlined in
this guidance, will support broader efforts to reduce the nation's cybersecurity
risks, contributing to a more stable technology ecosystem by incentivizing CSPs
to make security improvements that protect all of their Federal Government
customers.

The goal of this guidance is to strengthen and enhance the FedRAMP program.

FedRAMP has provided significant value to date, but the program must change to
meet the needs of Federal agencies and the evolving cloud marketplace. The
FedRAMP Marketplace must scale dramatically to enable Federal agencies to work
with many thousands of different cloud-based services that accelerate key agency
operations while allowing agencies to reduce the footprint of the information
technology (IT) infrastructure that they directly manage.[^3]

## Strategic Goals and Responsibilities

To achieve this, FedRAMP has several strategic goals and responsibilities:

- **Lead an information security program grounded in technical expertise and
  risk management.** FedRAMP is a security program that should, in consultation
  with industry and security experts across the Federal Government, focus
  Federal agencies and CSPs on the most impactful security features that protect
  Federal agencies from the most salient threats. To do this, FedRAMP must be
  capable of conducting rigorous reviews and identifying and requiring CSPs to
  rapidly mitigate weaknesses in their security architecture. At the same time,
  FedRAMP is a bridge between industry and the Federal Government, and is
  expected to thoughtfully navigate situations where unthinking adherence to
  standard agency practices in a commercial cloud environment could lead to
  unexpected or undesirable security outcomes.

- **Rapidly increase the size of the FedRAMP Marketplace by evolving and
  offering additional FedRAMP authorization paths.** FedRAMP has the challenging
  task of defining core security expectations for FedRAMP authorizations that
  will support the statutory presumption of their adequacy and lead to their
  reuse at the appropriate Federal Information Processing Standards Publication
  (FIPS) 199 impact level by agencies with a wide variety of risk postures.[^4]
  The presumption of adequacy is intended to engender trust in the FedRAMP
  Marketplace, create a consistent experience for cloud providers when
  navigating Federal security requirements, and ensure strong justifications for
  agency-specific requirements in the FedRAMP process. FedRAMP will develop
  alternative authorization paths for cloud computing products and services,
  beyond those described in this document, that embrace risk management
  principles, consistent with National Institute of Standards and Technology
  (NIST) standards and guidelines, and provide flexibility to agencies.

- **Streamlining processes through automation.** It is essential that FedRAMP
  establish an automated process for the intake, use, and reuse of security
  assessments and reviews. Automating the intake and processing of
  machine-readable security documentation, continuous monitoring data, and other
  relevant artifacts will reduce the burden on program participants and increase
  the speed of implementing cloud solutions in a timely manner.

- **Leverage shared infrastructure between the Federal Government and private
  sector.** FedRAMP should not incentivize or require commercial cloud providers
  to create separate, dedicated offerings for Federal use, whether through its
  application of Federal security frameworks or other program operations. The
  Federal Government benefits from the investment, security maintenance, and
  rapid feature development that commercial cloud providers give to their core
  products to succeed in the marketplace. Commercial providers similarly are
  incentivized to integrate improved security practices that emerge from their
  engagement with FedRAMP into their core services, benefiting all customers.

## FedRAMP's Structure

Structurally, FedRAMP consists of two parts: the PMO and the FedRAMP Board.

The PMO, located within GSA and led by the FedRAMP Director, is responsible for
operating a security authorization process that meets the needs of Federal
agencies, provides a navigable experience for CSPs, and complies with applicable
laws and policies, including this memorandum.

The FedRAMP Board, composed of Federal technology leaders appointed by OMB,
provides input to GSA, establishes guidelines and requirements for security
authorizations, consistent with relevant standards and guidelines of NIST, and
supports and promotes the program within the Federal community.
