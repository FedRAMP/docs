# M-24-15 Section I. Background

Since its establishment in 2011, FedRAMP has operated by partnering with
agencies and third-party assessors to identify appropriate cloud computing
products and services, and evaluate those products and services against a common
baseline of security controls. Agency authorizing officials use this information
to make informed, risk-based, and efficient decisions concerning the use of
those cloud computing products and services. Since FedRAMP's inception, agencies
have reused existing authorizations hundreds of times across over 300 offerings,
and the program has provided a consistent gateway for industry to navigate entry
and onboarding into the Federal marketplace.

When FedRAMP began, the Federal Government was focused on securely facilitating
agencies' use of commercially available infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
offerings, which provide virtualized computing resources natively designed to be
more scalable and automatable than traditional data center environments. In the
years since, the commercial cloud marketplace has grown, especially in the area
of software as a service (SaaS), which encompasses cloud- based applications
made available over the internet. The COVID-19 pandemic only further accelerated
the growth of the SaaS market, as shifts in the workplace landscape led more
organizations to rely on remote collaboration tools for their workforce and to
expand the online services they provide to their customers.

Because Federal agencies require the ability to use more commercial SaaS
products and services to meet their enterprise and public-facing needs, FedRAMP
must continue to change and evolve. While an IaaS provider might offer
virtualized computing infrastructure appropriate for general-purpose enterprise
uses, SaaS providers typically offer focused applications. A large agency might
rely on only a few IaaS providers to support its custom applications, but could
easily benefit from hundreds of different SaaS tools for various collaboration
and mission- specific needs. SaaS providers may also target highly-tailored use
cases that are only relevant to specific sectors and may not be useful to every
agency, but which can significantly enhance the effectiveness of the agencies
with missions in that sector.

Beyond the changing cloud marketplace, the Federal Government has learned
important cybersecurity lessons over the last decade that should be reflected in
its approach to cloud security. Keeping a step ahead of adversaries requires the
Federal Government to be an early adopter of innovative new approaches to cloud
security offered and used by private sector platforms. Federal agencies have
finite resources to dedicate to cybersecurity, and must focus those resources
where they matter the most. The use of commercial cloud services by Federal
agencies is itself a major cybersecurity benefit, freeing up resources that
would otherwise have to be dedicated to operating and maintaining in-house
infrastructure.

Similarly, FedRAMP must also focus its attention and engagement with industry on
security controls that lead to the greatest reduction of risk to Federal
information and agency missions, grounding them in security expertise and
real-world threat assessment. While defined compliance procedures can promote
consistency and basic rigor, it is important to emphasize FedRAMP's primary
purpose: to assist agencies in selecting and adopting cloud solutions with
appropriate safeguards for the security of the information they process. To that
end, FedRAMP must be an expert program that can analyze and validate the
security claims of Cloud Service Providers (CSPs), while making risk management
decisions that will determine the adequacy of a FedRAMP authorization for reuse
within the Federal Government.

Strategic changes to the FedRAMP program will ensure that it can enable the
Federal Government to safely use the best of the commercial cloud marketplace
for years to come.
