# M-24-15 Section IV. The FedRAMP Authorization Process

The FedRAMP program provides for the issuance of FedRAMP "authorizations,"
making it easier and more efficient for agencies to securely use cloud computing
products and services.[^7] When the FedRAMP PMO confirms that a Cloud Service
Offering (CSO)[^8] meets the rigorous standards of FedRAMP authorization
requirements and approves the offering for inclusion in the Marketplace, the CSO
is considered FedRAMP-authorized. A FedRAMP authorization is not an endorsement
of a product or service. Rather, by certifying that a cloud product or service
has completed a FedRAMP authorization process, FedRAMP establishes that the
security posture of the product or service has been assessed and is
presumptively adequate for use by Federal agencies. The assessment of security
controls and materials within a FedRAMP authorization package should also be
presumed adequate when incorporated into a broader authorization for another
CSO.

The FedRAMP Board shall establish and regularly update requirements and
guidelines for security authorizations of cloud computing products and services,
consistent with standards and guidelines established by NIST, to be used in the
determination of FedRAMP authorizations.[^9]

## **a. The Presumption of Adequacy**

FedRAMP should reduce duplicative work for agencies and companies alike,
bringing a measure of consistency and coherence to what the Federal Government
requires from cloud providers. To that end, if a given cloud product or service
has a FedRAMP authorization at a given FIPS 199 impact level, the Act requires
that agencies must presume the security assessment documented in the
authorization package is adequate for their use in issuing an authorization to
operate at or below that FIPS 199 impact level.[^10]

This presumption of adequacy applies as long as a FedRAMP authorization is
actively maintained by satisfying ongoing requirements (i.e., continuous
monitoring). For this presumption to be useful, FedRAMP should ensure that its
processes for authorization are usable for all types of cloud products and
services and for unique agency needs. Multiple agencies must be able to rely on
the FedRAMP authorizations.

This presumption of the adequacy of FedRAMP authorizations does not supersede or
conflict with the authorities and responsibilities of agency heads under the
Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA) to make
determinations about their security needs.[^11] An agency may overcome this
presumption if the agency determines that it has a "demonstrable need"[^12] for
security requirements beyond those reflected in the FedRAMP authorization
package,[^13] or that the information in the existing package is "wholly or
substantially deficient for the purposes of performing an authorization" of a
given product or service.[^14] If a new authorization is issued following
additional work, the agency that performed the additional authorization work
must document in the resulting authorization package the reasons that it found
the previous FedRAMP package deficient. The agency will inform the FedRAMP PMO
of the deficiency. The FedRAMP Director remains responsible for deciding whether
an agency's additional security needs merit conducting additional FedRAMP
authorization work, and thus using additional FedRAMP resources, to support a
revised package.

## **b. Authorization Process Requirements**

FedRAMP is responsible for defining the processes and criteria that must be met
in order for a cloud product or service to receive a FedRAMP authorization.[^15]
For cloud products and services that do not fall within the scope as described
in Section III, a FedRAMP authorization is not required. FedRAMP should take
advantage of the authorization work that is already happening within agencies
that can support Government-wide reuse. To that end, the FedRAMP program will
establish a process and criteria for expediting the authorization of packages
submitted by interested agencies with demonstrably mature authorization
processes.

FedRAMP is designed to enable use of innovative cloud technologies by Federal
agencies in a way that appropriately manages risks. Accordingly, the FedRAMP
authorization process should not only require CSPs to demonstrate security
capabilities that meet the expectations of Federal agencies, but should also
recognize the value of newer industry practices that offer alternative
implementation methods that improve security and/or compensate for controls that
would ordinarily be required. This process for assessing and documenting the
security of cloud computing products and services is a shared responsibility
between the agency and the CSP.

## **c. Authorization Paths**

To promote reusability while accommodating different use cases within the
Federal Government, FedRAMP will support the following paths to obtain FedRAMP
authorization:

### Agency Authorization

**Agency authorizations**, signed by the Federal agency's authorizing official,
indicate that an agency or a joint group of agencies assessed a CSP's security
posture in accordance with FedRAMP guidelines and found it acceptable. The
FedRAMP Director is responsible for ensuring that authorizations can reasonably
support the presumption of adequacy.

Authorizations by a single agency will be designed to enable the agency to
safely use a cloud product or service in a manner consistent with that agency's
use and risk tolerances.

Authorizations can also be conducted jointly by multiple agencies,[^16] to
enable a cohort of agencies with similar needs to pool resources and achieve
consensus on an acceptable risk posture for use of the cloud product or service.
The FedRAMP Board will proactively identify Federal agency IT leaders to form
authorization groups to expand the FedRAMP authorizing capacity of the Federal
ecosystem. CSOs that receive high reuse across the Federal enterprise make
likely candidates for joint authorizations to manage availability and other
security risks that cannot be accounted for in an individual agency's
determination of FIPS 199 impact level. For authorizations managed by multiple
agencies, agencies are expected to ensure efficient communication structures and
apply the presumption of adequacy.

### Program Authorization

**Program authorizations**, signed by the FedRAMP Director, indicate that
FedRAMP assessed a cloud service's security posture and found it met FedRAMP
requirements and is acceptable for reuse by agency authorizing officials.

These authorizations are intended to allow the FedRAMP program to enable
agencies to use a cloud product or service for which an agency sponsor has not
been identified, but for which use by a number of Federal agencies could be
reasonably expected should the CSO be authorized. These authorizations may also
be used for cloud services that have become widely adopted by agencies since
their initial FedRAMP authorization, to provide centralized and consistent
oversight and risk management.

### Other Paths

**Any other paths to authorization,** designed by the FedRAMP PMO, in
consultation with OMB and NIST, and approved by the FedRAMP Board, to further
promote the goals of the FedRAMP program. In all cases, any alternative pathways
will adhere to the rigorous standards of the FedRAMP program.

### Reponsibility

The FedRAMP PMO is responsible for ensuring that the various paths to
authorization successfully achieve their goals, and for generally enabling
Federal agencies to safely meet their mission needs. The FedRAMP PMO oversees
the process for all FedRAMP authorizations, and works with agency program staff
and authorizing officials to make necessary risk management decisions. Agency
authorizing officials determine acceptable risk for their agency, and the
FedRAMP Director determines acceptable risk for what can be called a FedRAMP
authorization. As part of the agency authorization process, agencies may decide
to authorize a CSP with an existing FedRAMP authorization at a higher impact
level after applying the appropriate tailoring process.[^17]

## **d. Assessing Security Postures**

Regardless of the authorization path, FedRAMP should consistently assess and
validate cloud providers' complex architectures and encryption schemes to ensure
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of cloud computing products and
services and to verify that relevant security control implementations are
reasonable and operate as intended. The FedRAMP Director should draw on
technical expertise across the Government and industry as necessary to ensure
that these assessments can be conducted. Assessments will include reviewing
documentation, and may also involve intensive, expert-led "red team"[^18]
assessments at any point during or following the authorization process.

The FedRAMP Board represents the needs of the Federal community and the
interests of the FedRAMP program as a whole, and should be responsive to the
evolving needs of the Federal community and the changing nature of the cloud
ecosystem. The FedRAMP Board is responsible under the Act for establishing and
regularly updating requirements and guidelines for security authorizations used
in the FedRAMP process.[^19] As such, the FedRAMP Board engages with the FedRAMP
PMO and its processes as a whole and is not expected to participate in the
approval of individual authorization packages.

The authorization process must integrate agile principles and recognize that
security is a risk-management process. To achieve this, FedRAMP will leverage
the use of threat information to prioritize control selection and
implementation. FedRAMP will update its security control baselines and will
tailor them using a threat-based analysis, produced in collaboration with
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) that focuses on the
application of those controls that address the most salient threats. The use of
threat analysis, threat intelligence, and threat modeling will help agencies
better identify the security capabilities necessary to reduce agency
susceptibility to a variety of threats, including hostile cyber-attacks, natural
disasters, equipment failures, errors of omission and commission, and insider
threats. This process will also apply to other review procedures, including when
a provider seeks to modify an existing FedRAMP-authorized service. Summary
findings of this analysis will be available to agencies engaged in the FedRAMP
authorization process.

## **e. Supporting the FedRAMP Marketplace**

The FedRAMP Marketplace facilitates interagency awareness of services available
for reuse. It displays cloud computing products and services that are in the
process of obtaining or have completed a FedRAMP authorization. The FedRAMP
Board may create additional designations for CSOs that may not constitute a full
authorization. These designations may be listed on the Marketplace to encourage
CSP adoption, security by design, and signify there has been coordination
between FedRAMP and an agency.

Similarly, to support a robust Marketplace, agencies may in some circumstances
require a FedRAMP authorization as a condition of contract award, but only if
there are an adequate number of vendors to allow for effective competition, or
an exception to legal competition requirements applies.[^20]

GSA, in consultation with the FedRAMP Board and the CIO Council, develops
criteria for prioritizing products and services expected to receive a FedRAMP
authorization.[^21] GSA will ensure that these criteria prioritize products and
services based on agency demand, as well as critical or emerging technologies
that might otherwise remain unavailable to agencies, while facilitating the
goals of this policy, such as automation, shared commercial platforms, and
reuse.

GSA will identify critical technologies unavailable to agencies and ensure the
criteria prioritize those technologies.

To identify more cloud service offerings that could become FedRAMP authorized,
and to accelerate their eventual path to being authorized, FedRAMP will provide
procedures for issuing a time-specific temporary authorization, as discussed in
NIST risk management guidelines,[^22] that would allow Federal agencies to pilot
the use of new cloud services that do not yet have a full FedRAMP authorization.
Consistent with FedRAMP's policies and procedures, such an authorization would
serve as a preliminary authorization to provide for use of the covered product
or service on a trial basis for a specified period of time, not to exceed twelve
months, with the goal of more easily supporting a potential full FedRAMP
authorization.[^23] After twelve months, the temporary authorization will
terminate, unless the CSP is in-progress for a full FedRAMP authorization. The
FedRAMP PMO will provide further guidance on pilots, including any notification
requirements.

    records management, privacy, and cybersecurity. For example, agencies are
    responsible for implementing privacy requirements for cloud products and
    services in alignment with their agency privacy program.

    FedRAMP provides the mechanism for agencies to leverage (reuse) existing
    authorization artifacts (such as system security plans and assessments) for
    cloud offerings with a FedRAMP authorization. In doing so, the appropriate
    agency authorizing officials must issue an authorization when reusing
    artifacts (such as system security plans and assessments) in the FedRAMP
    repository. An authorizing official is a senior agency official or executive
    with the authority to formally assume responsibility for operating an
    information system at an acceptable level of risk to agency operations and
    assets, for example.

    P-ATO, these authorizations can be issued by any group of agencies. Existing
    JAB P-ATOs at the time of the issuance of this memorandum will be
    re-designated as determined by the FedRAMP PMO in collaboration with the
