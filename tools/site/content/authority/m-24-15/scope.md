# M-24-15 Section III. Scope of FedRAMP

The Act charges OMB with specifying the categories or characteristics of cloud
computing products and services that receive authorizations through FedRAMP.[^5]
Agencies must obtain and maintain a FedRAMP authorization when the cloud product
or service falls within the scope of this section.

FedRAMP's goal is to ensure that Federal information systems and Federal
information continue to be protected, even when the agency that owns those
systems and information does not have complete control over them. FedRAMP does
not apply to every use of an internet- based service by a Federal agency.

## The Scope of FedRAMP

The scope of FedRAMP is **cloud computing products and services** (such as IaaS,
Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and SaaS) that create, collect, process, store, or
maintain Federal information on behalf of a Federal agency, and that are **not
otherwise specified as out of scope** below.[^6]

## Outside the Scope of FedRAMP

The following categories of cloud computing products and services are specified
as outside the scope of FedRAMP, subject to exceptions made by the FedRAMP
Director with the approval of OMB:

1. Information systems that are only used for a single agency's operations,
   hosted on cloud infrastructure or platform, and are not offered as a shared
   service or do not operate with a shared responsibility model;

2. Social media and communications platforms used in accordance with agency
   social media policies;

3. Search engines;

4. Widely available services that provide commercially available information to
   agencies, but do not collect Federal information;

5. Ancillary services whose compromise would pose a negligible risk to Federal
   information or information systems, such as systems that make external
   measurements or only ingest information from other publicly available
   services; and

6. Any other categories of products or services identified for exclusion by the
   FedRAMP Board, with the concurrence of the Federal CIO.

## Guidelines and Examples

New types of cloud products and services are frequently introduced in the cloud
marketplace. As this landscape continues to grow and change, FedRAMP should
adapt with it. FedRAMP, in consultation with OMB, will publish guidelines for
interpreting the categories above, with supporting examples that clearly
illustrate what types of services are in and out of scope.
