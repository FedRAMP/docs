# FedRAMP in United States Law

!!! abstract "The Statutory Establishment of FedRAMP"

    FedRAMP was established on **December 23, 2022** in Subtitle I, Title LIX, Subtitle C, Section 5921 of
    [Public Law 117-263 - James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023](https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/PLAW-117publ263). This law amended Chapter 36 of Title 44 of the United States Code.
