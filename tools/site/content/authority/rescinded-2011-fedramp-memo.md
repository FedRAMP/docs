MEMORANDUM FOR CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICERS 

FROM: Steven VanRoekel, Federal Chief Information Officer 

SUBJECT: Security Authorization of Information Systems in Cloud Computing Environments 

## 1. Introduction 

Cloud computing offers a unique opportunity for the Federal Government to take advantage of  cutting edge information technologies to dramatically reduce procurement and operating costs  and greatly increase the efficiency and effectiveness of services provided to its citizens.  Consistent with the President’s International Strategy for Cyberspace and Cloud First policy, the  adoption and use of information systems operated by cloud service providers (cloud services) by  the Federal Government depends on security, interoperability, portability, reliability, and  resiliency.  

Over the past 24 months, the Administration has worked in close collaboration with the National  Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the General Services Administration (GSA), the  Department of Defense (DOD), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the United States  Chief Information Officers Council (CIO Council) and working bodies such as the Information  Security and Identity Management Committee (ISIMC), state and local governments, the private  sector, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and academia to develop the Federal Risk and  Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP). This program introduces an innovative policy  approach to developing trusted relationships between Executive departments and agencies[^1] and cloud service providers (CSPs).  

FedRAMP will provide a cost-effective, risk-based approach for the adoption and use of cloud  services by making available to Executive departments and agencies: 

- Standardized security requirements for the authorization and ongoing cybersecurity of cloud  services for selected information system impact levels; 

- A conformity assessment program capable of producing consistent independent, third-party  assessments of security controls implemented by CSPs; 

- Authorization packages[^2] of cloud services reviewed by a Joint Authorization Board (JAB)  consisting of security experts from the DHS, DOD, and GSA; 

- Standardized contract language to help Executive departments and agencies integrate  FedRAMP requirements and best practices into acquisition; and 

- A repository of authorization packages for cloud services that can be leveraged government wide. 

FedRAMP will reduce duplicative efforts, inconsistencies and cost inefficiencies associated with  the current security authorization process. FedRAMP establishes a public-private partnership to  promote innovation and the advancement of more secure information technologies. By using an  agile and flexible framework, FedRAMP will enable the Federal Government to accelerate the  adoption of cloud computing by creating transparent standards and processes for security  authorizations and allowing agencies to leverage security authorizations on a government-wide  scale.
