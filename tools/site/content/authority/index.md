# Authority & Responsibility

FedRAMP is currently operating as a government-wide program established in
the law supported by OMB policy in mid-2024. These updated laws and policies
effectively "patched" historical FISMA requirements along with the OMB A-130
to formally establish FedRAMP as the program responsible for developing, 
coordinating, and implementing the government-wide process for assessing
and continuously monitoring the security of cloud services used by any
federal agency.

Agencies are required by both law and OMB policy to use the processes
established by FedRAMP.

This section includes easy to reference versions of the authority
and responsibilities for FedRAMP, agencies, and related entities from the
law and policy.

!!! info "Historical Executive Orders"

    This section **does not** include historical executive orders that
    no longer apply to FedRAMP because they have been rescinded or
