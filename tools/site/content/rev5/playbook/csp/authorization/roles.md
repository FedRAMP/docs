# Roles and Responsibilities

CSPs and 3PAOs should understand and agree on the division of roles and responsibilities with respect to the development of an authorization package. Although CSPs do not develop the SAP and SAR, they are responsible for reviewing and approving these documents. For this reason, this _CSP Playbook Volume II_ includes several tips on how to review the SAP and SAR for completeness, correctness, and consistency.

_\* CSPs are required to use FedRAMP templates for the SSP, security controls rules of behavior (RoB), information system contingency plan (ISCP), control implementation summary (CIS) and customer responsibility matrix (CRM) workbook, integrated inventory workbook, POA&M, and cryptographic modules table. CSPs develop their own policies and procedures, user guides, incident response plans, and configuration management plans. Additional guidance on each of these required documents is provided in Section 12 of the SSP template._  

_\*\* Per the [A2LA R311: Specific Requirements \- FedRAMP](https://a2la.qualtraxcloud.com/ShowDocument.aspx?ID=5621), 3PAOs contracted to provide advisory services cannot provide assessment services for the same CSO for a period of two years._  

_\*\*\* 3PAOs are required to use FedRAMP templates for the SAP, security test case procedures, SAR, and risk exposure table (RET)._
