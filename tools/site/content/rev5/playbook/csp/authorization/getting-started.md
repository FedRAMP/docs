# Is FedRAMP Right For You?

Federal agencies are required to obtain FedRAMP authorizations or reuse existing
FedRAMP authorizations for all cloud services within the
[scope of FedRAMP](https://fedramp.gov/scope). This means any company selling a
cloud service to the government that meets the criteria outlined in the
[scope of FedRAMP](https://fedramp.gov/scope) must obtain a FedRAMP
authorization.

!!! warning "FedRAMP only applies to cloud services used by federal government agencies"

    The law explicitly limits the application of FedRAMP to services used by federal
    government agencies (including some third-party services); FedRAMP will not
    invest government resources into assessment and authorization of services without
    a direct federal agency use-case.

A FedRAMP
[Rev5 Agency Authorization](https://www.fedramp.gov/rev5/agency-authorization/)
requires a security assessment based on Federal Information Security Management
Act (FISMA) requirements and National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) 800-53 baselines, and both are explained in greater detail in their
respective sections of this document.

In making a business decision regarding FedRAMP authorization for your service,
it is important to consider your overall strategy for federal government
customers. If you are brand new to the federal landscape, there may be a
learning curve associated with the procurement timeline, and you might want to
consider partnering with a systems integrator who has experience and a federal
government customer base. Conversely, if you already have a federal government
footprint and are looking to expand, FedRAMP authorization can be a business
development driver. FedRAMP provides cross-government visibility on the
[FedRAMP Marketplace](https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/products) and provides a
single security package that can be leveraged by multiple federal agencies for
review.

Please note that the initial authorizing agency determines whether or not the
data qualifies as federal information as well as the overall applicability of
FedRAMP in accordance with the
[OMB memorandum](https://www.fedramp.gov/resources/documents/FedRAMP_Policy_Memo.pdf).

General information, including resources, blogs, templates, and documentation
for authorization, can be found on FedRAMP’s [website](http://www.fedramp.gov).
