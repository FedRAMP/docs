# Is FedRAMP Right For You?

If you have a cloud service offering (CSO) that is being used by the federal
government, you should consider obtaining a FedRAMP authorization. Per an
[Office of Management and Budget (OMB) memorandum](https://www.fedramp.gov/resources/documents/FedRAMP_Policy_Memo.pdf),
cloud services that hold federal data must be FedRAMP Authorized. A FedRAMP
[Rev5 Agency Authorization](https://www.fedramp.gov/rev5/agency-authorization/)
requires a security assessment based on Federal Information Security Management
Act (FISMA) requirements and National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) 800-53 baselines, and both are explained in greater detail in their
respective sections of this document.

In making a business decision regarding FedRAMP authorization for your service,
it is important to consider your overall strategy for federal government
customers. If you are brand new to the federal landscape, there may be a
learning curve associated with the procurement timeline, and you might want to
consider partnering with a systems integrator who has experience and a federal
government customer base. Conversely, if you already have a federal government
footprint and are looking to expand, FedRAMP authorization can be a business
development driver. FedRAMP provides cross-government visibility on the
[FedRAMP Marketplace](https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/products) and provides a
single security package that can be leveraged by multiple federal agencies for
review.

Section III of the
[OMB memorandum](https://www.fedramp.gov/resources/documents/FedRAMP_Policy_Memo.pdf)
defines the scope of FedRAMP as cloud computing products and services such as
Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and
Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) that create, collect, process, store, or maintain
Federal information on behalf of a Federal agency. Section III also describes
categories of cloud computing products and services that are specified as
outside the scope of FedRAMP.

Please note that the initial authorizing agency determines whether or not the
data qualifies as federal information as well as the overall applicability of
FedRAMP in accordance with the
[OMB memorandum](https://www.fedramp.gov/resources/documents/FedRAMP_Policy_Memo.pdf).

General information, including resources, blogs, templates, and documentation
for authorization, can be found on FedRAMP’s [website](http://www.fedramp.gov).
