# Authorization Elements for Consideration

While we are currently piloting an approach to authorization that does not require agency sponsorship (see [20x Pilot](https://www.fedramp.gov/20x/goals/) for more information), there is currently one approach to obtaining a FedRAMP authorization: an authorization through a federal agency. No matter where a CSP is in their journey to FedRAMP authorization, each CSP should fill out the [CSP Information Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScU4_x5UK53d0PUUDsOdqWyzUvAN1-yFJ1NxffT7PkGkCiuPg/viewform). Completing the form will generate a unique FedRAMP ID for the cloud service offering and provide valuable resources in an automated follow-up email. This FedRAMP ID will remain the ID associated with your offering through the lifecycle of your FedRAMP journey even if your company name or product name changes.

## **Existing or Potential Agency Partners**

The first step in achieving a FedRAMP authorization is for a CSP to establish a partnership with a federal agency. Some CSPs may already have a federal agency that is interested in authorizing their CSO because they are either already using the system, in the process of procuring the system, or are using an on-premise version and wish to transition to a cloud version. Other CSPs may have potential customers who are interested in their service or may be responding to requests for proposals (RFPs) that include FedRAMP requirements. It is critical to discuss FedRAMP early in the process. FedRAMP can partner with CSPs in discussions with agencies to address questions or concerns about the authorization process.

## **Deployment Model**

CSPs should qualify whether their CSO is government-only community, public, or private, or exists as a hybrid cloud. FedRAMP adheres to [_NIST SP 800-145_](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-145.pdf) definitions when defining cloud deployment models.

|                                | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Government- Only Community** | The cloud holds only government data. Customers can be federal, state, local, tribal, territorial, federally funded research centers (FFRDCs), contractors working on behalf of the government, or lab entities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Public**                     | Public cloud deployments support both government and non-government customers. This aligns with the traditional model of cloud computing services.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Private**                    | Private cloud deployments intended for single organizations and implemented fully within federal facilities are not subject to the FedRAMP mandate and are the only exception to FedRAMP being mandatory for all federal agencies. For private clouds deployed in an IaaS/PaaS versus within a federal facility, the agency should use the FedRAMP process and baselines to authorize the cloud service; however, FedRAMP does not review packages for private clouds, grant a FedRAMP Authorized designation, or list them on the Marketplace because the concept of “reuse” does not apply. |
| **Hybrid**                     | Combination of cloud infrastructures (private, community, or public). Each cloud is a unique entity but is bound to other clouds to provide services to an organization (e.g., cloud bursting for load balancing between clouds).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

## **Impact Levels**

[Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 199](http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.199.pdf) provides the standards for categorizing information  
and information systems, which is the process CSPs use to ensure their services meet the minimum security requirements for processing, storing, and transmitting federal data. The security categories are based on the potential impact that certain events would have on an organization’s ability to accomplish its assigned mission, protect its assets, fulfill its legal responsibilities, maintain its day-to-day functions, and  
protect individuals.  
It is important that CSPs understand the impact level of their service offering(s) and corresponding  
security categorization when developing an authorization strategy. CSOs are categorized into one of  
three impact levels (Low, Moderate, and High) and across three security objectives (confidentiality, integrity  
and availability).

### Impact Levels

|                            | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Low Impact Levels**      | The Low-impact level is most appropriate for CSOs for which the loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability would result in limited adverse effects on a federal agency’s operations, assets, or individuals. FedRAMP currently has two baselines for systems with Low-impact data: LI-SaaS baseline and Low baseline. The LI-SaaS baseline accounts for low-impact SaaS applications that do not store personal identifiable information (PII) beyond what is generally required for login capability (i.e., username, password, and email address). Required security documentation is consolidated, and the requisite number of security controls needing testing and verification are lowered relative to a standard Low baseline authorization. |
| **Moderate Impact Levels** | Moderate-impact level systems account for nearly 80% of CSP services that receive FedRAMP authorization. It is most appropriate for CSOs for which the loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability would result in serious adverse effects on a federal agency’s operations, assets, or individuals. Serious adverse effects could include significant operational damage to federal agency assets, financial loss, or individual harm that is not loss of life or physical.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **High Impact Levels**     | High-impact data is usually in law enforcement and emergency services systems, financial systems, health systems, and any other system for which loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could be expected to have a severe or catastrophic adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals. FedRAMP introduced the High baseline to account for the federal government’s most sensitive, unclassified data in cloud computing environments, including data that involves the protection of life and against financial ruin.                                                                                                                                                                                   |

**Security controls included in the High, Moderate, Low, and LI-SaaS baselines can be found within the [FedRAMP Security Controls Baseline](https://www.fedramp.gov/resources/documents/FedRAMP_Security_Controls_Baseline.xlsx)**.

| NOTE: CSPs use the _Federal Information Process Standard (FIPS) 199 Categorization Template_ (embedded as Appendix K in the [system security plan (SSP) template](<https://www.fedramp.gov/resources/templates/FedRAMP-High-Moderate-Low-LI-SaaS-Baseline-System-Security-Plan-(SSP).docx>)), along with the guidance of [_NIST Special Publication 800-60 volume 2, revision 1_](http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-60v2r1.pdf), to correctly categorize their system based on the types of information processed, stored, and transmitted. Ultimately, the security impact level of a system is determined by the federal agency customer, as each AO will have different risk tolerance levels, and each federal agency’s mission is different, which may impact how they classify their data. For this reason, it is important for CSPs to coordinate with their federal agency customers to ensure agreement with their impact level classification. |
