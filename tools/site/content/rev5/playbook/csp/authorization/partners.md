# Partners in the Authorization Process

## FedRAMP

Responsible for providing a unified process to stakeholders, FedRAMP is a key
partner for cloud service providers (CSPs) researching or seeking FedRAMP
authorization for their CSO. Its responsibilities include stewardship of the
FedRAMP authorization process and enabling services to be reused across the
federal government by providing a secure repository of FedRAMP Authorized
packages. FedRAMP coordinates with multiple groups who represent various
interests and who play complementary roles within the FedRAMP ecosystem. To
learn more about the groups that make up FedRAMP, visit the
[FedRAMP Governance](https://www.fedramp.gov/governance/) page.

#### FedRAMP Secure Repository

To enable reuse of FedRAMP Authorized packages and continuous monitoring
(ConMon) deliverables, FedRAMP manages a secure repository on USDA Connect.gov
for cloud offerings categorized at LI-SaaS, Low, or Moderate.

Federal agency authorizing official (AO) representatives, and contractors
working on their behalf, may request temporary (60-day) access to a CSO's
repository for the purpose of reviewing the authorization package in order to
inform a risk-based authorization decision. Access requests are submitted to
FedRAMP via the
[_FedRAMP Package Access Request Form_](https://www.fedramp.gov/resources/documents/Agency_Package_Request_Form.pdf).
In addition to the form, agency contractors must sign the nondisclosure
agreement embedded as an attachment within the form.

Once a federal agency issues an authorization to operate (ATO) for a CSO,
FedRAMP provides permanent access to the CSO's repository. Federal agency AO
representatives, or contractors working on their behalf, require permanent
access to a CSO's repository for the purpose of reviewing ConMon deliverables to
ensure the security posture remains sufficient for their use of the CSO.

Each federal agency representative or contractor that requires access to a CSO's
repository must submit a FedRAMP Package Access Request Form; however, the form
may be used to request access to multiple CSO repositories.

CSPs with cloud offerings categorized at High must establish and maintain a
secure repository in an environment that is FedRAMP Authorized at High, or in an
environment that is fully owned, maintained, and operated by the CSP. FedRAMP
facilitates access to a CSO's High repository via the FedRAMP Package Access
Request Form; however, it is the CSP's responsibility to provision and control
access to the information.

## Federal Agencies

CSPs partner with a federal agency throughout the initial FedRAMP authorization
process. Agencies are responsible for reviewing CSP-developed security packages.
Ultimately, a federal agency's authorizing official (AO) must accept the risk
associated with the use of a cloud system through the issuance of an ATO for
their agency. Agencies should also conduct ConMon oversight of each authorized
system in use, reviewing monthly and annual deliverables provided by CSPs.

### Agency Authorizing Official

A federal agency's AO is a senior federal official who is ultimately responsible
for making a risk-based decision to grant a CSP's offering an ATO or Authority
to Use (ATU). The decision is formalized in an ATO letter provided to the CSP
system owner and FedRAMP. AOs have sufficient visibility across their
organization to understand the impact and cost of an individual CSO on the
security environment and operations of the agency.

!!! warning "The initial federal agency ATO is not a government-wide risk acceptance!"

    Likewise, the initial authorizing agency is not responsible for performing ConMon oversight on behalf of all federal agencies. Each federal agency must issue an ATO or ATU for its own use of the CSO and review ConMon deliverables to ensure the security posture remains sufficient for the agency's continued use. CSPs with multiple federal agency customers must establish a collaborative approach to ConMon as outlined in the [FedRAMP Continuous Monitoring Playbook](../continuous-monitoring/intro.md).

## Third Party Assessment Organizations (3PAOs) aka Independent Assessors

As independent third parties, 3PAOs perform initial and periodic assessments of
cloud systems to ensure they meet FedRAMP requirements. CSPs pursuing a FedRAMP
authorization must have their CSOs assessed by an independent third party. Most
CSPs choose a FedRAMP recognized 3PAO that meets the necessary quality,
independence, and FedRAMP knowledge requirements to perform required independent
security assessments. However, a federal agency may choose to use their
Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) organization to assess a CSO.
FedRAMP recognized 3PAOs can be found on the
[FedRAMP Marketplace](https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/assessors).

!!! info "Agency approved independent assessment"

    If a federal agency elects to use its own IV&V team or a third-party assessor that is not a FedRAMP recognized 3PAO, the federal agency AO must attest to the independence of the assessment organization. In addition, the assessment organization must use FedRAMP-provided templates.
