_Figure 1: FedRAMP Agency Authorization Process_

This is the same as the process displayed in the [FedRAMP Agency Authorization Playbook](https://www.fedramp.gov/resources/documents/Agency_Authorization_Playbook.pdf), but it is from the CSP’s perspective. It includes additional steps that both the CSP and agency would complete.

### Phase 1: Preparation

#### FedRAMP Ready

A FedRAMP Ready designation is optional for the FedRAMP agency authorization process, but highly recommended. To achieve the FedRAMP Ready designation, a CSP must work with a FedRAMP recognized 3PAO to complete a Readiness Assessment of its service offering. The Readiness Assessment Report (RAR) documents the CSP's capability to meet federal security requirements.  
CSPs that achieve the FedRAMP Ready designation are listed on [FedRAMP’s Marketplace](https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/products). Agencies use the FedRAMP Marketplace to research cloud services that meet their organizational requirements. If a CSP is interested in pursuing government clients, becoming FedRAMP Ready makes available valuable information about the service offering’s security for potential federal agency customers via the FedRAMP Marketplace.  
Additionally, for CSPs who are considering whether or not to become FedRAMP Authorized, the RAR can serve as a self assessment to determine what gaps in their service offering’s security exist and where those gaps might be. Such information can help CSPs understand the level of effort necessary to secure their system(s) according to FedRAMP requirements prior to pursuing a FedRAMP authorization with a federal agency.

#### Pre-Authorization

##### Partnership Establishment

In the pre-authorization phase, a CSP formalizes their partnership with a federal agency. In some cases, a vendor may be under contract with a federal agency already, or a federal agency may be working through the acquisition process. At this stage, a CSP should have a fully operational system and an executive team that is committed to the FedRAMP process. CSPs should begin engagement with FedRAMP by filling out a [CSP Information Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScU4_x5UK53d0PUUDsOdqWyzUvAN1-yFJ1NxffT7PkGkCiuPg/viewform?c=0&w=1). By completing this form, FedRAMP will generate a FedRAMP ID for the CSO and provide valuable resources in an automated follow-up email.  
Prior to identifying a federal agency partner, a CSP should determine the security categorization of the data that will be placed within the system. CSPs should use the _Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 199 Categorization Template_ (Appendix K) in the [SSP template](<https://www.fedramp.gov/resources/templates/FedRAMP-High-Moderate-Low-LI-SaaS-Baseline-System-Security-Plan-(SSP).docx>), along with the guidance of [_NIST Special Publication 800-60 volume 2, revision 1_](http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-60v2r1.pdf), to correctly categorize their system based on the types of information processed, stored, and transmitted on their systems. This analysis will inform a CSP as to which impact level is most appropriate for their system. Once a partnership is in place, a CSP should confirm their impact level with the agency, which will conduct its own FIPS 199 assessment.

#### Authorization Planning

Once the partnership is established, a CSP should:

- Confirm resources dedicated to the authorization process, which should include one technical writer, one technical SME, and one project manager, at a minimum.
- Select a 3PAO for the assessment.
- Determine the federal agency’s approach for reviewing the authorization package as described below:

| Just-In-Time Linear Approach                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | All Deliverables Provided Simultaneously                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Each FedRAMP deliverable builds upon another, starting with the SSP. The SSP and appendices, Security Assessment Plan (SAP), and Security Assessment Report (SAR) are completed in a linear fashion, obtaining feedback from the federal agency once each deliverable is produced. In turn, modifications are made to each deliverable based on the agency’s review. Once the deliverable is finalized and accepted by the agency, work begins on the next deliverable. | All FedRAMP deliverables (i.e., the SSP and appendices, SAP, SAR, Plan of Action and Milestones \[POA\&M\]) are completed and submitted to the agency at once. The agency reviews all deliverables together and works collaboratively with the CSP and 3PAO. |

| HELPFUL TIP: FedRAMP recommends the “Just-In-Time” approach, as it is a more iterative and agile approach that may prevent rework after 3PAO testing has occurred. |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

- Work with your federal agency partner to complete an [in-process request (IPR)](https://fedramp.gov/resources/templates/FedRAMP-Agency-Authorization-In-Process-Request-Template.docx) and a [work breakdown structure (WBS](https://www.fedramp.gov/resources/templates/FedRAMP-Agency-Authorization-WBS-Template.xlsx)[)](https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/templates/FedRAMP-Agency-Authorization-WBS-Template.xlsx). After the completion of the IPR and WBS, please send these documents to FedRAMP for review via [intake@fedramp.gov](mailto:intake@fedramp.gov). At this point, the CSO is eligible to be listed as In Process on the FedRAMP Marketplace with agency approval.
  - If you are working with a DoD agency toward FedRAMP authorization at the IL4 or IL5 level, please reach out to FedRAMP for an IPR specific to DISA.
- After submitting the WBS and the IPR, FedRAMP will provision access to FedRAMP’s secure repository for Low and Moderate impact offerings (High impact offerings must use their own organization’s secure repository).
- Upload a copy of the CSP’s completed [Kickoff meeting deck](https://www.fedramp.gov/resources/templates/FedRAMP-Agency-Authorization-Kickoff-Architecture-Briefing-Guidance.pdf) to the secure repository.

#### Kickoff Meeting

The final step in this phase is to prepare for and conduct a kickoff meeting. The purpose of the kickoff meeting is to formally begin the FedRAMP agency authorization process by introducing key team members, reviewing the CSO, and making sure everyone is aligned on the overall process and milestone timelines. At the conclusion of the kickoff meeting, all stakeholders will have a shared understanding of:

- The overall authorization process, milestones, deliverables, roles and responsibilities, and schedule;
- The CSO’s purpose and function, authorization boundary, data flows, known security gaps and plans for remediation, federal agency-specific requirements, customer responsible controls, and areas that may require federal agency risk acceptance;
- The federal agency’s process for reviewing the authorization package and reaching a risk-based authorization decision; and
- Best practices and tips for success.

Additionally, CSPs that are not already listed as In Process on the FedRAMP Marketplace are eligible to be listed if the federal agency is comfortable with the briefing and timelines. Please note that not all systems will be eligible to be listed based on the kickoff meeting outcome, so be sure to have your initial agency partner engage with FedRAMP on your In Process status after this step.

| While your federal agency point of contact (POC) may be someone on the program side, it is critical to connect with the security side of the agency and, ultimately, the federal agency AO, who is required to send an In Process request to FedRAMP prior to a CSP achieving an In Process designation. If your program owner does not know who to go to in their agency for this, FedRAMP can assist. |

### Phase 2: Authorization

#### Full Security Assessment

During this phase, the 3PAO develops a SAP and tests the CSP’s system according to the FedRAMP guidelines and requirements. If the CSP has partnered with a federal agency, and is using the “Just-In-Time” linear approach described in the table above, it is recommended that the agency approve the SAP before the 3PAO initiates testing. During testing, it is critical that no changes are made to the CSO, and that it is frozen from a development perspective. Once the testing is complete, the 3PAO will develop a SAR, which details their findings and includes a recommendation for FedRAMP authorization. The CSP will then develop a POA\&M, based on the SAR findings, which outlines a plan for addressing the findings from testing. The SAR should clearly enumerate all risks identified during the security assessment.  
Once this has been completed, the CSP and 3PAO complete a SAR debrief presentation. The presentation is uploaded to the CSP’s secure repository for review prior to scheduling the SAR debrief meeting. FedRAMP provides guidance for developing SAR debrief presentation materials. Please reach out to [intake@fedramp.gov](mailto:intake@fedramp.gov) for a copy of the guidance.  
The purpose of the SAR debrief is to help inform the federal agency’s risk review of the CSO. During the SAR debrief, the 3PAO presents the results of the security assessment, and the CSP presents the plan and timeline for remediating residual risk.  
At the conclusion of the SAR debrief, all stakeholders will have a shared understanding of:

- The 3PAO’s assessment approach, methodology, and schedule;
- The scope of testing, which includes validation of the authorization boundary and data flows;
- The assessment results and residual risk;
- The CSP’s plan and timeline for remediating residual risk;
- Deviation requests that require federal agency approval (risk adjustments and false positives);
- Operationally required risks that require federal agency risk acceptance (e.g., services or components essential to the operation of the CSO but excluded from the tested boundary);
- The federal agency’s process for reviewing the authorization package and reaching a risk-based  
  authorization decision; and
- Best practices and tips for success.

##### Agency Authorization Process

Once the assessment and associated deliverables are complete, the federal agency reviews them and either approves them or requests that additional testing take place. A final review is then conducted, and if the federal agency accepts the risk associated with the use of the system, they provide an ATO letter signed by the federal agency AO.

| After the agency AO issues the ATO letter, FedRAMP performs a cursory review of the authorization package to determine suitability for government-wide reuse and makes a FedRAMP authorization decision. The scope of FedRAMP’s review includes: |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                             |

The review team reaches out to stakeholders with areas that require clarification or technical security gaps that may require remediation prior to authorization. This is typically done via email, but may require a meeting. Once requests for clarification and/or gaps have been addressed, the review team submits a final review report and authorization recommendation to FedRAMP leadership for approval.. Once approved, the FedRAMP Marketplace designation is changed to “FedRAMP Authorized.” A copy of the final review report is provided to all stakeholders and typically includes post-authorization actions that must be addressed by the CSP and/or 3PAO, and then reviewed by the partner agency. |                                                                                                                             |

Once a CSO receives a FedRAMP Authorized designation, the FedRAMP Marketplace will be updated to reflect the designation. FedRAMP will make the CSO security package available, upon request and validation of the requestor, to the entire federal government for the purpose of issuing subsequent ATOs for the use of the service based on their own reviews of the CSO’s security documentation. Due to the sensitivity of the materials, this information is highly controlled through the use of the [FedRAMP Package Access Request Form](https://www.fedramp.gov/resources/documents/Agency_Package_Request_Form.pdf) that must be routed through appropriate signatures within the federal government. Each form requires FedRAMP’s approval to review the documents.

| Once a cloud service has achieved a FedRAMP Authorized designation, each subsequent federal agency customer must still provide their own ATO for the use of the service. Federal agencies have an easy path to this view of FedRAMP’s reuse model; once the authorization is complete, any federal agency may review the security package, determine acceptability of risks associated with using the service, and issue their own ATO. If any federal agency customers are confused about this process, FedRAMP can support calls to discuss it. All signed agency ATO letters must be sent to FedRAMP. FedRAMP’s [Quick Guide for Reusing Authorizations for Cloud Products](https://www.fedramp.gov/resources/documents/Reusing_Authorizations_for_Cloud_Products_Quick_Guide.pdf) outlines the step-by-step process for agencies to issue their own ATOs for FedRAMP Authorized CSOs. |

### Phase 3: Continuous Monitoring

Throughout the authorization phase, CSPs are required to maintain the CSO, which includes performing ConMon activities. The CSP’s ability to demonstrate a mature ConMon process is one of the areas evaluated during the 3PAO’s assessment and during the federal agency and FedRAMP’s review of an authorization package. Failure to demonstrate a mature ConMon process will prevent or delay a FedRAMP Authorized designation.  
Once the authorization phase is complete, a CSP continues to provide monthly ConMon deliverables via the secure repository to the agencies that are using their service. These deliverables include an updated POA\&M, raw vulnerability scan files and reports, deviation requests, significant change requests, incident reporting, and the annual assessment package. Each federal agency using the service reviews the monthly ConMon deliverables. CSPs with cloud offerings categorized at LI-SaaS, Low, or Moderate use the FedRAMP secure repository for posting monthly ConMon materials. CSPs with cloud offerings categorized at High use their own secure repository.  
CSPs with more than one federal agency customer are required to implement a collaborative ConMon approach, intended to streamline the ConMon process and potentially minimize duplicative efforts in a way that helps each federal agency still perform their due diligence related to ConMon. This approach is described in the [FedRAMP Collaborative ConMonPlaybook](https://www.fedramp.gov/resources/documents/Continuous_Monitoring_Playbook.pdf). Collaborative ConMon benefits agencies by allowing them to share responsibility for ConMon oversight, and it benefits the CSP by creating a central forum for addressing questions and achieving consensus related to deviation requests, significant change requests, and the annual assessment, versus having to coordinate with each federal agency separately.  
Additionally, CSPs must employ an independent assessment organization or 3PAO to complete an annual security assessment to ensure that the risk posture of the system is maintained at an acceptable level throughout the lifecycle of the system. The annual assessment, along with updated security authorization package documentation, must be uploaded to the FedRAMP secure repository. FedRAMP should be notified via [info@fedramp.gov](mailto:info@fedramp.gov) when this is complete.
