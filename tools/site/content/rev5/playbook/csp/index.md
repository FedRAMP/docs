!!! question "What is the difference between Rev5 and 20x?"

    FedRAMP Rev5 Agency Authorizations (aka "sponsored authorization") are the
    only widely available path to FedRAMP authorization at this time.

    FedRAMP 20x is a newer modern path that is designed to be more appropriate
    for cloud-native systems that rely on modern engineering and security
    principles. This path is under development and is not available to the
    public at this time. For more information about the status and future
    plans for FedRAMP 20x, please review the content at 
    [FedRAMP.gov/20x](https://fedramp.gov/20x).
