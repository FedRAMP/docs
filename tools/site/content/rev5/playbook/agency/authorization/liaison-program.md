# Agency Liaison Program

FedRAMP Agency Liaisons are dedicated points of contact within most federal agencies who serve as the bridge connecting an agency and FedRAMP. The FedRAMP Agency Liaison Program established a voluntary community of trained individuals that will serve as a unified voice across federal agencies as they teach and facilitate FedRAMP processes and procedures. The goals of the FedRAMP Agency Liaison Program are to promote faster and more efficient authorizations and enable agency liaisons to train others within their agencies about the FedRAMP process.

## Program Benefits Include

- **Increased collaboration** by facilitating a direct line of communications between federal agencies, bureaus, and FedRAMP.

- **Increased awareness of FedRAMP** by improving understanding of FedRAMP and the FedRAMP Marketplace throughout the federal government.

- **Greater efficiency** by establishing a single point of expertise that can lead to faster authorizations and less use of resources over time.

- **Improved visibility** to increase transparency into program updates and strategic initiatives.

## How to Leverage FedRAMP Agency Liaisons

FedRAMP Agency Liaisons can answer general questions about FedRAMP, the FedRAMP reuse process, the initial authorization process, and continuous monitoring (ConMon). Liaisons attend FedRAMP-hosted meetings to learn about new program initiatives, updated requirements and guidance, and other topics that impact federal agencies. Liaisons can also provide clarification on the status of cloud vendors within their own federal agencies and can help answer questions about how to secure partnership for initial FedRAMP authorization at their agencies.

Most major Federal Agencies have an agency liaison who can serve as the subject matter expert and resource for questions about FedRAMP. Many sub agencies and departments have designated their own liaisons as well. If you are unsure who your agency liaison is or are interested in participating in the liaison community, please contact [info@fedramp.gov](mailto:intake@FedRAMP.gov). If your agency does not have a liaison identified, FedRAMP can help you designate a point of contact and enroll your federal agency in the program.
