## Why Use FedRAMP

!!! abstract "FedRAMP is mandatory for federal agencies!"

    "Agencies must obtain and maintain a FedRAMP authorization when the cloud product or service falls within the [scope \[of FedRAMP\]](https://fedramp.gov/scope)..." - OMB Memorandum M-24-15, "Modernizing FedRAMP"

- Federal agencies have the opportunity to save money and time by adopting innovative cloud services to meet their critical mission needs.

- Federal agencies are required by law to protect federal data stored in the cloud. Federal agencies do this by authorizing cloud services following FedRAMP guidelines and requirements.

- FedRAMP provides a standardized approach to security authorization consistent with Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) and National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) security requirements. One of our main goals is to prevent agencies from reinventing the wheel. The "do once, use many" approach promotes reuse of standardized security assessments to save federal agencies time and resources.

- FedRAMP facilitates collaboration across the federal government and regularly provides guidance and support to help federal agencies through the authorization process.
