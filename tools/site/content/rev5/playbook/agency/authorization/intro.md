# Introduction

# Why Use FedRAMP

- Federal agencies have the opportunity to save money and time by adopting innovative cloud services to meet their critical mission needs.
- Federal agencies are required by law to protect federal data stored in the cloud. Federal agencies do this by authorizing cloud services following FedRAMP guidelines and requirements
- FedRAMP provides a standardized approach to security authorization in accordance with Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) and National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) security requirements. One of our main goals is to prevent agencies from reinventing the wheel. The “do once, use many” approach promotes reuse of standardized security assessments to save federal agencies time and resources.
- FedRAMP facilitates collaboration across the federal government and regularly provides guidance and support to help federal agencies through the authorization process.

# Why This Playbook

- This playbook is designed as a reference for agencies pursuing an initial FedRAMP authorization. For information on how to reuse an existing authorization, reference the [_FedRAMP Reusing Authorizations for Cloud Products Quick Guide_](https://www.fedramp.gov/resources/documents/Reusing_Authorizations_for_Cloud_Products_Quick_Guide.pdf).
- The purpose of this playbook is to provide federal agencies with guidance, best practices, and tips to successfully implement the FedRAMP authorization process.
- The overall goal of this playbook is to promote transparency and consistent expectation management between federal agencies and cloud service providers (CSPs).
- Reference this playbook throughout the process in conjunction with ongoing communication with FedRAMP.

# What You Will Get From This Playbook

# FedRAMP’s Transition to 20x and Rev 5 Balance Improvement Releases

With the emergence of the next generation FedRAMP Authorization process, FedRAMP [20x](https://www.fedramp.gov/20x/goals/), the current Rev5 Authorization process is expected to cease operations at the end of FY27. To this end, FedRAMP will be limiting updates to current Rev5 processes, guidance documents, and templates. However, as 20x processes and standards are formalized, those with applicability to the current Rev5 processes will be integrated as part of FedRAMP’s Rev5 Balance Improvement Release (BIR) initiative. Each Rev5 BIR will undergo beta testing phases with volunteer Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) and agencies prior to wide release and full implementation.

More information about the Rev5 BIR process, see our write-up in [Github](https://github.com/fedRAMP/community/discussions/38). To see all past and emerging standards associated with the Rev 5 BIR, please see our [Public Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/FedRAMP/projects/25). The following content in this playbook is focused on the Agency Authorization Rev5 process. For all 20x updates please ensure you are following along in your Community Working Group (CWG) [discussion forum](https://github.com/FedRAMP/community/discussions/) for 20x and are following our [changelog](https://www.fedramp.gov/changelog/) for the most recent FedRAMP updates.
