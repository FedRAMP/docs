# Understanding the FedRAMP Marketplace

The [FedRAMP Marketplace](https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/products) provides a searchable, sortable database of cloud service offerings (CSOs) that have achieved a FedRAMP designation. Federal agencies can use the FedRAMP Marketplace to find secure cloud tools that meet their mission needs.  
Federal agencies are encouraged to use the FedRAMP Marketplace as a resource to:

- Research CSOs that are FedRAMP Authorized, FedRAMP Ready, or FedRAMP In Process
- Research federal agencies that use FedRAMP Authorized CSOs
- Research FedRAMP recognized 3PAOs

**Reusing FedRAMP Authorized CSOs**  
CSOs that are FedRAMP Authorized are made available for government-wide use. Federal agencies can leverage the security documentation of a FedRAMP Authorized CSO by following the process outlined in _[FedRAMP’s Reusing Authorizations for Cloud Products Quick Guide](https://www.fedramp.gov/resources/documents/Reusing_Authorizations_for_Cloud_Products_Quick_Guide.pdf)_.

# FedRAMP Designations

FedRAMP defines three different designations for CSOs: FedRAMP Ready, FedRAMP In Process, and FedRAMP Authorized.

- **FedRAMP Ready**: A designation provided to CSOs which indicates that a 3PAO attests to a CSO’s security capabilities, and that a FedRAMP Readiness Assessment Report (RAR) has been reviewed and deemed acceptable by FedRAMP. FedRAMP Ready indicates a CSO has a higher likelihood of successfully completing an initial FedRAMP authorization.
- **FedRAMP In Process**: A designation provided to CSOs that are actively working toward a FedRAMP authorization. For updates, federal agencies can either contact the cloud provider via the email address provided on the CSO’s FedRAMP Marketplace page, or reach out directly to FedRAMP via [intake@fedramp.gov](mailto:intake@FedRAMP.gov).
- **FedRAMP Authorized**: A designation provided to CSOs that have successfully completed the FedRAMP authorization process. FedRAMP Authorized CSOs are available for government-wide reuse.

| Important Note: There are no other FedRAMP recognized designations. Terms such as “FedRAMP Compliant” or “FedRAMP Equivalent” or any other FedRAMP implied authorization is NOT recognized by the FedRAMP PMO. |
