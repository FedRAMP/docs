# FedRAMP Rev5 Documentation and Playbooks

This site contains digital-first FedRAMP documentation and playbooks
focused on the traditional FedRAMP Rev5 authorization path. These materials
replace traditional off-line documents (such as PDF or DOCX) with responsive
on-line materials that can be viewed on a variety of devices, directly
linked to, and are always up to date.

!!! info "Modernization in Progress!"

    FedRAMP is working incrementally to migrate legacy documentation to this
    site. Most legacy Rev5 materials still require downloading off-line
    documents and are available in the 
    [Rev5 Documents and Templates](https://www.fedramp.gov/rev5/documents-templates/) 
    section of this site.

    As documents are migrated we will provide redirects to their new location
    whenever possible.

## Balance Improvement Releases

The FedRAMP Authorization Act and M-24-15 directed a government-wide modernization
of the assessment and authorization process for cloud computing services and products. 
This modern process, called [FedRAMP 20x](https://fedramp.gov/20x), is being built as
an entirely new process to directly address the majority of historical pain points in
the legacy FedRAMP Rev5 process.

Many of the improvements designed for FedRAMP 20x are being carefully tested and
released incrementally for optional use by FedRAMP Rev5 authorized providers. These
releases are called **Balance Improvement Releases** because the goal is to ensure
that FedRAMP Rev5 authorized providers have security and monitoring improvements balanced
against the modernizations made for FedRAMP 20x.

The [Balance Improvement Releases](balance/intro.md) section of this Rev5 site includes
an overview of all Balance Improvement Releases including a list of mandatory and optional
processes.
