## **FedRAMP’s transition to 20x and Rev 5 Balance Improvement Releases**

With the emergence of the next generation FedRAMP Authorization process, FedRAMP
[20x](https://www.fedramp.gov/20x/goals/), the current Rev5 Authorization
process is expected to cease operations at the end of FY27. To this end, FedRAMP
will be limiting updates to current Rev5 processes, guidance documents, and
templates. However, as 20x processes and standards are formalized, those with
applicability to the current Rev5 processes will be integrated as part of
FedRAMP’s Rev5 Balance Improvement Release (BIR) initiative. Each Rev5 BIR will
undergo beta testing phases with volunteer Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) and
agencies prior to wide release and full implementation.  
More information about the Rev5 BIR process, see our write-up in
[Github](https://github.com/fedRAMP/community/discussions/38). To see all past
and emerging standards associated with the Rev 5 BIR, please see our
[Public Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/FedRAMP/projects/25). The following
content in this playbook is focused on the Agency Authorization Rev5 process.
For all 20x updates please ensure you are following along in your Community
Working Group (CWG)
[discussion forum for 20x](https://github.com/FedRAMP/community/discussions/)
and are following our [changelog](https://www.fedramp.gov/changelog/) for the
most recent FedRAMP updates.
