# A fresh take on FedRAMP Documentation

<p style="font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.6;">
This section contains digital-first FedRAMP documentation including
definitions, requirements, recommendations, key security indicators, laws,
memorandums, and playbooks.
</p>

These materials replace traditional off-line documents (such as PDF or DOCX)
with responsive on-line materials that can be viewed on a variety of devices,
directly linked to, and are always up to date.
