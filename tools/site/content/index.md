# FedRAMP Documentation

This site contains digital-first FedRAMP documentation and playbooks
focused on the traditional FedRAMP Rev5 authorization path. These materials
replace traditional off-line documents (such as PDF or DOCX) with responsive
on-line materials that can be viewed on a variety of devices, directly
linked to, and are always up to date.

!!! info "Modernization in Progress!"

    FedRAMP is working incrementally to migrate legacy documentation to this
    site. Most legacy Rev5 materials still require downloading off-line
    documents and are available in the 
    [Rev5 Documents and Templates](https://www.fedramp.gov/rev5/documents-templates/) 
    section of this site.

    As documents are migrated we will provide redirects to their new location
    whenever possible.
