Overlays provide a specification of security or privacy controls, control enhancements, supplemental guidance, and other supporting information as part of the tailoring process, that is intended to complement (and further refine) security control baselines. The overlay may be more stringent or less stringent than the original security control baseline and can be applied to multiple information systems.\"</li> <li>NIST SP 800-53B Section 2.5 states \"As the number of controls in [SP 800-53] grows in response to an increasingly sophisticated threat space, it is important for organizations to have the ability to describe key capabilities needed to protect organizational missions and business functions, and to subsequently select controls that—if properly designed, developed, and implemented—produce such capabilities. The use of capabilities simplifies how the protection problem is viewed conceptually. Using the construct of a capability provides a method of grouping controls that are employed for a common purpose or to achieve a common objective.\" This section later states \"Ultimately, authorization decisions (i.e., risk acceptance decisions) are made based on the degree to which the desired capabilities have been effectively achieved.\"</li> <li>NIST SP 800-53A Section 3.5 states \"When organizations employ the concept of capabilities, automated and manual assessments account for all security and privacy controls that comprise the security and privacy capabilities. Assessors are aware of how the controls work together to provide such capabilities.\"</li> <li>FedRAMP Authorization Act (44 USC § 3609 (a) (1)) requires that the Administrator of the General Services Administration shall \"in consultation with the [DHS] Secretary, develop, coordinate, and implement a process to support agency review, reuse, and standardization, where appropriate, of security assessments of cloud computing products and services...\" 44 USC § 3609 © (2) further states that \"the [GSA] Administrator shall establish a means for the automation of security assessments and reviews.\"</li> </ul>","path":["20x Phase Two","Key Security Indicators"],"tags":[]},{"location":"20xP2/FRMR.KSI.key-security-indicators/#purpose","level":3,"title":"Purpose","text":"<p>Modern cloud services use automated or code-driven configuration management and control planes to ensure predictable, repeatable, reliable, and secure outcomes during deployment and operation.
