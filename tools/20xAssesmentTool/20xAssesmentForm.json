An achievement is a specific design choice, process, or other measure that meets the objective. For each achievement they will list 1 - n objectiveMonitoring which are specific tests that validate the achievement. Finally each objectiveMonitoring will list 1 - n evidence. which will be the actual output of the test. I am anticipating that there will be a lot of repetition here. The CSP SHOULD either use native JSON constructs like $ref or if they are managing the data in another system then they can simply output the repetitive data. Although that will make the JSON MUCH bigger so maybe we should encourage the use of $ref. and have a separate file for each of these elements?",
