# FedRAMP Machine Readable (FRMR) Documentation

This respository contains:

1. Machine-readable FedRAMP documentation for 20x in the `data` subdirectory
2. Tools and templates to convert FRMR JSON into enriched markdown
3. A [Zensical](https://zensical.org/about)-based static site renderer for viewing 

> **Please Note:** This repository previously contained basic markdown for direct viewing but moving forward FedRAMP will focus on enriched markdown for increased viewability.

## Using the JSON Data

The public is strongly encouraged to develop supporting systems that read FRMR docs directly, especially for integration in tools. Nothing beyond the JSON files in the `data` directory are necessary to begin leveraging these files.

FedRAMP is actively and aggressively developing and improving the JSON structure and associated metadata to improve the value of FRMR docs and may occasionally make breaking changes during the 20x pilots. FedRAMP will be seeking feedback during Phase Two and Phase Three for opportunities to improve and may open this repository up to public contribution.

## Building the Static Site

Stay tuned for tweaks as we work through standardizing this whole process.
