## FedRAMP Machine-Readable (FRMR) Docs

FedRAMP Machine-Readable requirements, recommendations, definitions, and key security indicators for FedRAMP 20x and FedRAMP Rev5 Balance Improvement Releases are available in this repository. These materials are the authoritative source of truth for FedRAMP processes. 

Stakeholders are **strongly encouraged** to directly integrate FRMR docs with their GRC engineering and automation systems as this is the most effective way to always have the latest version with additional enrichment.

| Available Materials | Description |
| -- | -- |

Other content in this repository includes traditional FedRAMP documentation in enriched markdown and the [related scaffolding](tools/README.md) to develop and build the static documentation site.
