The simplest way to prevent exploitation of internet-reachable vulnerabilities is to intercept, inspect, filter, sanitize, reject, or otherwise deflect triggering payloads before they are processed by the vulnerable resource; once this prevention is in place the vulnerability should no longer be considered an internet-reachable vulnerability.\n\nA classic example of an internet-reachable vulnerability on systems that are not typically internet-accessible is SQL injection (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection), where an application stack behind a load balancer and firewall with no ability to route traffic to or from the internet can receive a payload indirectly from the internet that triggers the manipulation or compromise of data in a database that can only be accessed by an authorized connection from the application server on a private network.\n\nAnother simple example is the infamous Log4Shell (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log4Shell) vulnerability from 2021, where exploitation was possible via vulnerable internet-reachable resources deep in the application stack that were often not internet-accessible themselves."

The likelihood of exploitation will vary depending on so many factors that FedRAMP will not recommend a specific framework for approaching this beyond the recommendations and requirements in this document.\n\nThe proof, ultimately, is in the pudding - providers who regularly evaluate vulnerabilities as not likely exploitable without careful consideration are more likely to suffer from an adverse impact where the root cause was an exploited vulnerability that was improperly evaluated. If done recklessly or deliberately, such actions will have a potential adverse impact on a provider's FedRAMP authorization."
